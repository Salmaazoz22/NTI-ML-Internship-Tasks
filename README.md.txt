# NTI ML Internship Tasks (July 2025)

This repository contains the tasks I completed during the **NTI Machine Learning Internship** in July 2025. Each folder represents a different dataset or machine learning problem, covering essential concepts in data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## 📁 Project Structure

| Folder      | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `Ad`        | Predictive modeling based on ad data (possibly ad-click prediction). |
| `boston2`   | Boston Housing dataset task #2 – regression and feature analysis. |
| `bostonT1`  | Boston Housing dataset task #1 – exploratory data analysis and regression. |
| `compines`  | ML task involving company data – potentially salary prediction or classification. |
| `housing`   | General housing data analysis using regression models. |
| `MPG`       | Miles Per Gallon dataset – regression modeling, feature engineering. |
| `salary`    | Salary prediction task using position levels or experience. |
| `titanic`   | Titanic survival classification using logistic regression and decision trees. |
| `Tv`        | TV advertisement and sales data – regression and correlation analysis. |
